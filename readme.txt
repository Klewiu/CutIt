##CutIt## is an application that improves the operation of cutting processing in a company dealing with carpentry, furniture or advertising displays. Users, depending on their access level, can create, delete and restore cutting orders. In each of the orders, you can add subsequent cuts from different materials that create a cut list for the given order for the operator.
